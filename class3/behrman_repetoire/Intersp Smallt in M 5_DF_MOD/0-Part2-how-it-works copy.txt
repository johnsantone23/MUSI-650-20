how pitch-hits send tuning changes to shelving DigSyns.
â€”the same bangs as above > Sect-entry-Pt2 where they bang thru, from the
hybrid coll Part2-DSyn-hit-sets+, via the sends: 
DSyn1-tunings, DSyn2-tunings, DSyn1-modu & DSyn2-modu.
these sends are received by r's in DigSyn1-Pt2-plyM & DigSyn2-Pt2-plyM
DSyn1Tngs has p DS & DSyn2Tngs

rename DigSynTngsM to DigSyn1-TngsM and the other DigSyn2-TngsM
or redo as p, with same name.
